    <h4>About</h4>
   <p>Welcome!  Here we will be collecting various Impression 
    styled artworks to culminate into an online gallery.  There 
    will be no focus on specific time periods in order to
    celebrate Impressionism throughout history and modern days.
    We wish to display these works while also organizing reference 
    photos for aspiring artists who wish to take a swing at 
    impressionism.  We hope this impression will leave you 
    impressed!!!</p>
