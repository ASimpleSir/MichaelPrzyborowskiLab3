    <h4>About</h4>
   <p>Welcome!  Here we will be collecting various Impression 
    styled artworks to culminate into an online gallery.  There 
    will be no focus on specific time periods in order to
    celebrate Impressionism throughout history and modern days.
    We wish to display these works while also organizing reference 
    photos for aspiring artists who wish to take a swing at 
    impressionism.  We hope impression will leave you 
    impressed!</p>
    <p>Impressionism makes use of of thin, yet visisble brush strokes
    that create a sense of movement within said works, and makes use 
    of highlights to bring different values to a form.  The forms within
    Impressionist works usually have a much more gestural quality to them
    as the brush strokes evoke sketchy linework.  In that sense, Impressionism 
    was furthering down a path of artists focusing more on using linework
    and highlights to guide the viewer along a canvas.
