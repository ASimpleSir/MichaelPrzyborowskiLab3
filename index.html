    <h4>About</h4>
   <p>
        Welcome!  Here we will be collecting various Impression 
        styled artworks to culminate into an online gallery.  There 
        will be no focus on specific time periods in order to
        celebrate Impressionism throughout history and modern days.
        We wish to display these works while also organizing reference 
        photos for aspiring artists who wish to take a swing at 
        impressionism.  We hope impression will leave you 
        impressed!

        Impressionism makes use of of thin, yet visisble brush strokes
        that create a sense of movement within said works, and makes use 
        of shadows and highlights to bring different values to a form.  The forms
        withinImpressionist works usually have a much more gestural quality to them
        as the brush strokes evoke sketchy linework.  In that sense, Impressionism 
        was furthering down a path of artists focusing more on using linework
        and highlights to guide the viewer along a canvas.

    <h4>History</h4>
    <h6>First Impressions</h6>
    <p>
        Impressionism saw it's beginnings in Paris, France from an art exhibit
        held by members of the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, Printmakers,
        etc.: Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet, and others.  The art 
        exhibit of said members would be more akin to a culmination of eyesores 
        than anything else as per conservative critics at the time do to the artists'
        rough and sketchy design philosophy.  However, progressive-leaning reviewers 
        were marveled by how said artists captured modern life in a manner that would
        revolutionize the painters world at the time, thus Impressionism was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        Impressionism had not been a name each member agreed upon, as they wished not
        to be viewed as a school or movement, but a critic of Claude Monet's, “<b>Soleil 
        Levant</b>”, would help coin the term <i>Impressionism</i> by referring to said 
        work as not a finished painting, but rather an Impression of a sunrise.  Art can 
        definitely be seen as a tool for spite, so it isn't too suprising that the criticism
        by Louis Leroy would help fuel the movement.

    <h6>Adoption</h6>
        As previously mentioned, Impressionism makes use of highlights and shadows to
        bring different values to a form, but these values would be made using more vivid
        colors compared to the standard blacks, grays, and whites.  This coupled with
        the loose and gestural brush strokes used had given impressionism it's casual aura,
        an aura that rapidly grew to be the manner in which modern society shall be 
        depicted within the artistic society of the time.  Impressionism had even been
        accepted by the official <u>Salon</u>, the art gallery hosted by Académie des Beaux-Arts,
        ironically of which the members of the Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, 
        Printmakers, etc. were independent of.

        <h4>Present Impressions</h4>
        Impressionism was the beginning of the age of modern art, providing artists a simpler 
        method of artistic expression that allows for more stylistic freedom within painting,
        drawing, sculpting, printmaking, etc..  A personal favorite aspect regarding Impressionism
        to me is it's blending of drawing and painting.  Brush strokes are clearly defined with 
        Impressionist style works whereas the expecation with classical art was capture the moment
        in a sense that the viewer could truly envision themselves at the scene as if it were
        happening in front of them, as if a past-era form of photography.  The method of 
        Impressionism captures the moment more like a memory, where the important information is
        exemplified, while smaller details are tapered off.

        <h4><u><b>YOUR</b></u> First Impressions</h4>
        I compiled a short list of images that would work great as Impressionist style works.  I 
        reccomend tracing out the lines and shapes of the forms present, especially for begginners,
        but then feel free to express yourselves with various ranges of colors, and try to avoid
        blacks, whites, and grays.  For example, in the second image of the old man, your highlights
        could consist of bright yellows and pinks, your midtones could consist of orange tones, and 
        your shadows could complement with say an olive green or ranges of blues and violets.
